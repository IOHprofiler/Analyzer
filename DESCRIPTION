Description: This is the data analyzing tool of Iterative Optimization Heuristics
    Profiler (IOHprofiler). This tool provides the statistical analysis on the 
    benchmark data of optimization heuristics, which can be visualized through a 
    web-based interface. The benchmark data is usually generated from the 
    experimentation part, called IOHExperimenter. Importantly, we do also support
